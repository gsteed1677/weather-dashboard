# weather-dashboard

This project will show a weather dashboard that uses api calls to get the local weather and a 5 days forecast. You can input a city name into the search bar and it will tap into the api and present the data.

The data should come back with temp, humidity, windspeed and more. It will also have icons attached to make it more uer and visibly friendly.

I will also store the past searches in local storage so you can refer back to them.
